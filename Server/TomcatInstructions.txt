1.  Copy the folder tomcat from shareout\comp\7855 to C drive/folder of computer.

2.  In the file c:\tomcat\conf\server.xml replace 
<Server port="8005" shutdown="SHUTDOWN"> with <Server port="8006" shutdown="SHUTDOWN">, and 
<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" connectionTimeout="20000" redirectPort="8443" /> with
<Connector port="8081" protocol="HTTP/1.1" connectionTimeout="20000" redirectPort="8443" />.

3.  set the following environment variables (as exemplified below)
CATALINA_HOME C:\tomcat
JRE_HOME C:\Apps\Java\jre-11.0.4.11-hotspot
JAVA_HOME C:\Apps\Java\jdk-11.0.4.11-hotspot
also add C:\Apps\Java\jdk-11.0.4.11-hotspot\binto the Path system variable

To set environment variables, click on windows icon on the bottom left of your desktop. 
Expand "Windows System" folder that appears towards the bottom of the program list.  
From "Control Panel" select System -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables.
Click on "New..." button for System variables.  
Add the above top 3 system variables one by one if any one of them does not already exist.  
JAVA_HOME is probably already there but JRE_HOME and CATALINA_HOME would need to be added. 

Click on the Path in the System variables and then click on "New".  
Add C:\Apps\Java\jdk-11.0.4.11-hotspot\bin to the list.

4.  copy the folder midp from the comp7855 share out into C:\tomcat\webapps

5. start a windows command prompt from "Windows System" (where you found Control Panel previously)
cd c:\tomcat\bin and then type startup.bat
Allow network connection if such permissions window show up.
If everything was configured properly, a new command window will be launched that will display log messages,
 none of these should be an error or a warning.

6.  Open Internet Explorer and type http://localhost:8081
You should see a tomcat manager web page.  

type http://localhost:8081/midp/hits and you should see the following on the web page.
Hits: 1
refreshing the page will increment the count.

7. type shutdown.bat on the window where you typed startup.bat


You have basically configured apache tomcat and deployed a simple web app that counts number of hits.
Check out C:\tomcat\webapps\midp\WEB-INF\web.xml and C:\tomcat\webapps\midp\WEB-INF\classes\HitServlet.java files.

Although HitServlet.class file already exists.  You can compile the java file to create the class file as follows:
on a windows command prompt type the following
cd C:\tomcat\webapps\midp\WEB-INF\classes
javac -classpath .;c:\tomcat\lib\servlet-api.jar HitServlet.java
